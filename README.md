# Bachelor's Thesis Project: Checking CAD Files for Box-Maker Company Requirements

## Overview
This project was created as part of the requirements for a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering. The goal of this project was to use Python to check if a CAD file had some specific requirements asked by a box-maker company.

## Contents
This project contains the following files:
- `run.py`: the main Python script that checks the CAD file for the requirements
- `cad_file.dxf`: a sample CAD file to be checked

## Usage
To run the script, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You also need to install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```
